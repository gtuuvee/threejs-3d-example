# ThreeJS 3D Example

In this example, we create a scene, a camera, and a renderer using Three.js. We then create a cube using a `BoxGeometry` and a `MeshBasicMaterial`, and add it to the scene. Finally, we use the `requestAnimationFrame` method to render the scene and animate the rotation of the cube. The result is a simple 3D scene with a rotating cube.
